				I am <b>Sagar Anand, Computer Science</b> Graduate from <b>Birla Institute of Technology &amp; Science, Pilani (overall CGPA of 7.49 and core CGPA of 7.98)</b>. 

				I am currently working at <b>Walmart Global Technologies, Bangalore as an Information Security Developer under the Information Security branch of the E-Commerce division</b>. I am a keen developer and have extensive experience in development on web technologies in particular. I frequently take up side projects to convert them to fully functional units for clients.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have a passion for <b>Software Engineering and Development</b>. I like to develop things that simply work, exposing interfaces that work without all the complexity behind the scenes.

				I am particularly working in the field of Information Security and am currently working on a <b>hardware based security solution for storing the sensitive information of an enterprise</b>.

				I have also been working on the tech interface for Mentored-Research, an online assignment-based course provider in the field of finance. This project started back in college and now the site is up and running with over 1000 students enrolled across all the courses of Mentored-Research. Other than that, I have been working on developing APIs, both in <b>Java-Spring-Hibernate platform and NodeJs-MongoDb-AngularJs platform</b>.  
			</p>

			<p>
				In my free time, I really like to teach students about the new and cool stuff that exists in the market. I have taken a few sessions in universities like LPU, Jalandhar to give those students a better idea of industry best practices and placement preparations.
