		"abstract": "This thesis aims at programming and configuring a Cognitive Radio to enable its transceiver to use the best wireless channels in its vicinity. Such a radio automatically detects available channels in wireless channels, and then accordingly changes its transmission and reception parameters to allow more concurrent wireless communications in a given spectrum, thus gaining dynamic spectrum management."
